**Postmortem: Service Outage on 2024-02-20**

**Issue Summary:**

- Duration: The outage occurred from 12:00 PM to 2:30 PM (UTC).
- Impact: The outage affected the entire service, resulting in 90% of users experiencing slow or unavailable service.
- Root Cause: The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the deployment, leading to excessive resource consumption.

**Timeline:**

- 12:00 PM (UTC): Issue detected through monitoring alerts showing a spike in resource usage.
- Actions: Engineers investigated the database, application server, and network components for potential issues. Initially assumed it was a database bottleneck.
- Misleading Paths: Initially suspected a database bottleneck due to recent updates, but further investigation disproved this theory.
- Escalation: Incident escalated to senior engineering team for additional support.
- Resolution: The misconfiguration was identified and corrected, restoring normal service by 2:30 PM (UTC).

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- Cause: Misconfiguration in the recommendation algorithm's deployment caused excessive resource consumption, leading to service degradation.
- Resolution: The misconfiguration was corrected by reverting to a previous stable configuration and implementing stricter monitoring of resource usage.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- Improvements/Fixes:
    - Implement stricter testing and review processes for algorithm deployment configurations.
    - Enhance monitoring to quickly detect and respond to similar issues in the future.
- Tasks:
    - Implement automated testing for algorithm deployments (TODO: by 2024-03-15).
    - Conduct a review of all deployment configurations to ensure they meet resource consumption guidelines (TODO: by 2024-03-11).
    - Enhance monitoring to include real-time resource consumption alerts (TODO: by 2024-03-11).
